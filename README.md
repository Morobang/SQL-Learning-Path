## � How Each Topic is Organized

Each numbered topic folder (like `6-Grouping-and-Aggregation/`) contains:

- **📖 `concepts/`** - Learn the theory and understand WHY
- **💻 `examples/`** - See working SQL code and HOW to implement
- **🏋️ `exercises/`** - Practice problems to test your knowledge
- **📚 `resources/`** - Quick references and troubleshooting tips

### Example Learning Flow:
1. **Read** → `concepts/group-by-basics.md` to understand the theory
2. **Run** → `examples/01-group-by-examples.sql` to see it in action
3. **Practice** → `exercises/README.md` to test your understanding
4. **Reference** → `resources/cheat-sheet.md` when you need quick help

---

## �💡 Study Tips

1. **Follow the 4-Step Flow**: Concepts → Examples → Exercises → Resources
2. **Hands-On Practice**: Always run the SQL examples yourself
3. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts to real-world scenarios  
4. **Join Communities**: Stack Overflow, Reddit r/SQL, SQL Discord servers
5. **Daily Practice**: 30 minutes daily beats 3 hours once per week
6. **Use the Structure**: Don't mix learning and practicing - use the right folder for your current need
