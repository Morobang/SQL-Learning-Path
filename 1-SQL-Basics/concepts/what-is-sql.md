# What is SQL? - Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamentals of Structured Query Language and its role in data management.

## üéØ Definition and Purpose

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.

### Key Purposes of SQL:
- ‚úÖ **Retrieve data** from databases (Querying)
- ‚úÖ **Insert new data** into databases
