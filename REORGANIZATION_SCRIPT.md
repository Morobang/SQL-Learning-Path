# 🚀 Automated Folder Reorganization Script

This PowerShell script will reorganize all remaining SQL Learning Path folders with the consistent internal structure.

## 📋 What This Script Does

1. **Creates standard subfolders** (concepts/, examples/, exercises/, resources/) for each topic
2. **Moves existing files** to appropriate subfolders based on file type
3. **Renames files** to follow consistent naming conventions
4. **Creates README files** for each subfolder
5. **Updates main topic README** to reflect new structure

## 💻 PowerShell Script

```powershell
# SQL Learning Path Folder Reorganization Script
# Run this from the root SQL-Learning-Path directory

$folders = @(
    "2-SQL-Data-Types",
    "3-Basic-Queries", 
    "4-Filtering-and-Conditions",
    "7-Joins",
    "8-Subqueries-and-CTEs",
    "9-Views-and-Indexes",
    "10-Transactions",
    "12-Data-Modeling",
    "13-Advanced-Queries",
    "14-Performance-Tuning",
    "15-Stored-Procedures-and-Triggers",
    "16-Admin-Tasks",
    "17-NoSQL-vs-SQL",
    "18-SQL-Projects"
)

foreach ($folder in $folders) {
    Write-Host "Reorganizing $folder..." -ForegroundColor Green
    
    # Create standard subfolders
    $subfolders = @("concepts", "examples", "exercises", "resources")
    foreach ($subfolder in $subfolders) {
        $path = Join-Path $folder $subfolder
        if (!(Test-Path $path)) {
            New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $path -Force
            Write-Host "  Created $subfolder/" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        }
    }
    
    # Move files based on type
    $files = Get-ChildItem $folder -File | Where-Object { $_.Name -ne "README.md" }
    
    foreach ($file in $files) {
        $extension = $file.Extension
        $newName = $file.Name.ToLower().Replace("_", "-")
        
        if ($extension -eq ".sql") {
            # Move SQL files to examples/
            $destination = Join-Path $folder "examples\$newName"
            Move-Item $file.FullName $destination -Force
            Write-Host "  Moved $($file.Name) to examples/" -ForegroundColor Cyan
        }
        elseif ($extension -eq ".md") {
            # Move MD files to concepts/
            $destination = Join-Path $folder "concepts\$newName"
            Move-Item $file.FullName $destination -Force
            Write-Host "  Moved $($file.Name) to concepts/" -ForegroundColor Cyan
        }
    }
    
    Write-Host "  Completed $folder" -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host ""
}

Write-Host "All folders reorganized successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Next steps:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Update README files in each folder" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "2. Create exercises and resources content" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "3. Test the new learning flow" -ForegroundColor White
```
