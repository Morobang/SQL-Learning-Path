## 💡 Key Concepts Preview

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Inefficient query
SELECT * FROM orders o
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM customers c 
    WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
    AND c.city = 'New York'
);

-- Optimized version
SELECT o.* FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.city = 'New York';
```

### Index Strategy
```sql
-- Query that needs optimization
SELECT customer_id, order_date, total_amount
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
  AND status = 'completed'
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- Create composite index to support this query
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date_status 
ON orders(order_date DESC, status)
INCLUDE (customer_id, total_amount);
```

### Execution Plan Analysis
```sql
-- Enable execution plan display (SQL Server)
SET STATISTICS IO ON;
SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON;

-- Analyze your query
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;
```

### Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Find slow queries (SQL Server example)
SELECT TOP 10
    qs.execution_count,
    qs.total_elapsed_time / qs.execution_count as avg_elapsed_time,
    qs.total_logical_reads / qs.execution_count as avg_logical_reads,
    SUBSTRING(qt.text, qs.statement_start_offset/2+1,
        (CASE WHEN qs.statement_end_offset = -1 
         THEN LEN(CONVERT(nvarchar(max), qt.text)) * 2
         ELSE qs.statement_end_offset END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2+1) as query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
ORDER BY avg_elapsed_time DESC;
```

## 🏆 Optimization Methodology

### The ACID Approach to Performance
1. **Analyze**: Identify slow queries and bottlenecks
2. **Create**: Design solutions (indexes, query rewrites)
3. **Implement**: Apply changes in controlled manner
4. **Deliver**: Measure improvements and validate results

### Performance Tuning Checklist
- [ ] Identify top resource-consuming queries
- [ ] Analyze execution plans for inefficiencies
- [ ] Check for missing or unused indexes
- [ ] Review query patterns and rewrite if needed
- [ ] Test changes in non-production environment
- [ ] Monitor results after implementation
- [ ] Document changes and maintain performance baselines

## ⚠️ Common Performance Killers

1. **SELECT *** on large tables
2. **Missing WHERE clause indexes**
3. **Unnecessary GROUP BY operations**
4. **Correlated subqueries** that could be JOINs
5. **Function calls in WHERE clauses**
6. **Implicit data type conversions**
7. **Over-indexing** (too many indexes)
8. **Outdated statistics**

## 🎓 Advanced Optimization Techniques

- **Partition Pruning**: Eliminate entire partitions from query execution
- **Parallel Query Processing**: Leverage multiple CPU cores
- **Query Hint Optimization**: Guide optimizer behavior when needed
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-compute expensive aggregations
- **Connection Pooling**: Reduce connection overhead
- **Read Replicas**: Distribute read load across multiple servers

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

```sql
-- Check for blocking queries
SELECT blocking_session_id, wait_type, wait_time, 
       session_id, status, command
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests 
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

-- Find missing indexes (SQL Server)
SELECT d.*, s.avg_total_user_cost, s.avg_user_impact
FROM sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats s
JOIN sys.dm_db_missing_index_groups g ON s.group_handle = g.index_group_handle
JOIN sys.dm_db_missing_index_details d ON g.index_handle = d.index_handle
ORDER BY s.avg_user_impact DESC;

-- Check index usage
SELECT i.name, s.user_seeks, s.user_scans, s.user_lookups
FROM sys.indexes i
JOIN sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats s ON i.object_id = s.object_id 
    AND i.index_id = s.index_id
WHERE OBJECT_NAME(i.object_id) = 'your_table_name';
