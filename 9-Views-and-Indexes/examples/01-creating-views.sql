-- üéØ SECTION 1: BASIC VIEWS

-- Example 1: Simple View for Public Book Catalog
CREATE VIEW book_catalog AS
SELECT book_id, title, author, genre, published_year
FROM books
WHERE in_stock = true;

-- üîç What this does: Creates a safe view without prices or stock status
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM book_catalog;

-- Example 2: View with Calculated Column
CREATE VIEW book_summary AS
SELECT 
    book_id,
    title,
    author,
    genre,
    published_year,
    page_count,
    -- Calculate century based on published year
    CASE 
        WHEN published_year < 1900 THEN '19th Century'
        WHEN published_year < 2000 THEN '20th Century' 
        ELSE '21st Century'
    END as century,
    -- Categorize by length
    CASE
        WHEN page_count < 200 THEN 'Short'
        WHEN page_count < 400 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Long'
    END as length_category
FROM books;

-- üîç What this does: Adds calculated columns for century and book length
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM book_summary WHERE century = '20th Century';

-- üéØ SECTION 2: SECURITY-FOCUSED VIEWS

-- Example 3: View for Student Volunteers (Limited Access)
CREATE VIEW student_volunteer_view AS

    br.first_name,
    br.last_name,
    l.loan_date,
    l.due_date
FROM loans l
JOIN books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN borrowers br ON l.borrower_id = br.borrower_id
WHERE l.return_date IS NULL;  -- Only show current loans

-- üîç What this does: Shows current loans without sensitive data
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM student_volunteer_view;

-- Example 4: View for Librarians (More Access)
CREATE VIEW librarian_view AS
SELECT 
    l.loan_id,
    b.title,

    l.loan_date,
    l.due_date,
    l.return_date,
    -- Calculate overdue status
    CASE 
        WHEN l.return_date IS NULL AND l.due_date < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'Overdue'
        WHEN l.return_date IS NULL THEN 'On Loan'
        ELSE 'Returned'
    END as loan_status
FROM loans l
JOIN books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN borrowers br ON l.borrower_id = br.borrower_id;

-- üîç What this does: Shows loan details with status calculations
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM librarian_view WHERE loan_status = 'Overdue';

-- üéØ SECTION 3: AGGREGATION VIEWS

-- Example 5: Genre Statistics View
CREATE VIEW genre_statistics AS
SELECT 
    genre,
    COUNT(*) as total_books,
    AVG(page_count) as avg_pages,
    MIN(published_year) as oldest_book,
    MAX(published_year) as newest_book,
    SUM(CASE WHEN in_stock THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as books_in_stock
FROM books
GROUP BY genre;

-- üîç What this does: Provides summary statistics by genre
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM genre_statistics ORDER BY total_books DESC;

-- Example 6: Borrower Activity View
CREATE VIEW borrower_activity AS
SELECT 
    br.borrower_id,
    br.first_name || ' ' || br.last_name as borrower_name,

    SUM(CASE WHEN l.return_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as current_loans,
    -- Calculate membership duration in months
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, br.membership_date)) as membership_months
FROM borrowers br
LEFT JOIN loans l ON br.borrower_id = l.borrower_id
GROUP BY br.borrower_id, borrower_name, br.membership_date;

-- üîç What this does: Shows borrower activity and statistics

    l.loan_id,
    l.loan_date,
    l.due_date,
    l.return_date,
    br.borrower_id,
    br.first_name || ' ' || br.last_name as borrower_name,
    -- Calculate book age
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, MAKE_DATE(b.published_year, 1, 1))) as book_age_years
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN loans l ON b.book_id = l.book_id AND l.return_date IS NULL
LEFT JOIN borrowers br ON l.borrower_id = br.borrower_id;

-- üîç What this does: Shows complete library status with current loans
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM library_overview WHERE in_stock = false;

-- üéØ SECTION 5: VIEW MANAGEMENT

-- Show all views in the database
SELECT table_name as view_name 
FROM information_schema.views 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- View definition
SELECT definition 
FROM pg_views 
WHERE viewname = 'library_overview';

-- Update a view (replace it)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW book_catalog AS
SELECT book_id, title, author, genre, published_year, page_count
FROM books
WHERE in_stock = true;

-- Drop a view
-- DROP VIEW IF EXISTS book_catalog;

-- üéØ SECTION 6: PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

-- Example 8: View for Popular Books (Borrowed frequently)
CREATE VIEW popular_books AS
SELECT 
    b.book_id,
    b.title,
    b.author,
    b.genre,
    COUNT(l.loan_id) as times_borrowed,
    MAX(l.loan_date) as last_borrowed
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN loans l ON b.book_id = l.book_id
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.title, b.author, b.genre
HAVING COUNT(l.loan_id) > 0
ORDER BY times_borrowed DESC;

-- Example 9: View for Overdue Books
CREATE VIEW overdue_books AS
SELECT 
    l.loan_id,
    b.title,
    b.author,
    br.first_name || ' ' || br.last_name as borrower_name,
    br.email,
    l.loan_date,
    l.due_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - l.due_date as days_overdue
FROM loans l
JOIN books b ON l.book_id = b.book_id
JOIN borrowers br ON l.borrower_id = br.borrower_id
WHERE l.return_date IS NULL AND l.due_date < CURRENT_DATE;

-- üîç What this does: Shows all overdue books with contact info
-- üìä Usage: SELECT * FROM overdue_books ORDER BY days_overdue DESC;

-- Example 10: View for Book Recommendations
CREATE VIEW book_recommendations AS
SELECT 
    b1.book_id,
    b1.title,
    b1.author,
    b1.genre,
    b1.published_year,
    -- Suggest similar books based on genre
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM books b2 
     WHERE b2.genre = b1.genre AND b2.book_id != b1.book_id) as similar_books_count
FROM books b1
WHERE b1.in_stock = true
ORDER BY similar_books_count DESC, b1.published_year DESC;

-- üéØ SECTION 7: USING VIEWS IN QUERIES

-- Query 1: Find available classic books
SELECT * FROM book_catalog WHERE genre = 'Classic';

-- Query 2: Show borrowers with current loans
SELECT borrower_name, current_loans 
FROM borrower_activity 
WHERE current_loans > 0 
ORDER BY current_loans DESC;

-- Query 3: Contact borrowers with overdue books
SELECT borrower_name, email, title, days_overdue
FROM overdue_books
WHERE days_overdue > 7
ORDER BY days_overdue DESC;

-- Query 4: Genre analysis for collection development
SELECT 
    genre,
    total_books,
    books_in_stock,
    ROUND((books_in_stock::decimal / total_books) * 100, 2) as percentage_in_stock
FROM genre_statistics
ORDER BY percentage_in_stock ASC;

-- üéØ SECTION 8: VIEWS WITH PARAMETERS (Using functions)

-- Create a function that acts like a parameterized view
CREATE FUNCTION get_books_by_year_range(start_year INT, end_year INT)
RETURNS TABLE (
    book_id INT,
    title VARCHAR,
    author VARCHAR,
    published_year INT,
    genre VARCHAR
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT b.book_id, b.title, b.author, b.published_year, b.genre
    FROM books b
    WHERE b.published_year BETWEEN start_year AND end_year
    ORDER BY b.published_year;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- üîç Usage: SELECT * FROM get_books_by_year_range(1900, 1950);

-- üéØ SECTION 9: MATERIALIZED VIEWS (Advanced)

-- Create a materialized view for better performance
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_loan_stats AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', loan_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as total_loans,
    COUNT(DISTINCT borrower_id) as unique_borrowers,
    AVG(EXTRACT(DAY FROM due_date - loan_date)) as avg_loan_duration
FROM loans
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', loan_date)
ORDER BY month DESC;

-- üîç Materialized views store actual data and need refreshing
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_loan_stats;

-- üéì SUMMARY: WHY USE VIEWS?

-- 1. üîí Security: Hide sensitive data
-- 2. üëì Simplification: Make complex queries easy
-- 3. üìä Consistency: Standardize calculations
-- 4. üõ°Ô∏è Abstraction: Protect from schema changes
-- 5. üéØ Organization: Logical data presentation

-- üöÄ BEST PRACTICES:

-- 1. Use descriptive view names
-- 2. Document what each view is for
-- 3. Avoid nesting views too deeply
-- 4. Consider performance implications
-- 5. Regularly review and clean up unused views

-- üßπ Cleanup (uncomment to remove all views)
